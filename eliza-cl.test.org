#+TITLE: Eliza Tests
# Intended for import at level 2
* Introduction
This is mostly an experiment:

1. At the emacs level it is about building compound documents using =#+INCLUDE:= to break up org documents.

2. At the literate programming level it is about beginning to incorporate testing into literate documents.

3. At the Common Lisp level is about learning =lisp-unit= for unit testing.

4. At the Common Lisp development environment level it is about learning =quicklisp=. It is good that I broke =quicklisp= and =ASDF= into seperate exercises. Without understanding a bit about =ASDF= I was confused when looking at =quicklisp= and when I looked at =quicklisp= it just made me confused about =ASDF=.

* Base File
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp :noweb tangle :tangle test/eliza.test.lisp
  <<lu-install>>

  <<lu-package>>

  <<lu-test-one>>
#+END_SRC
* Installing lisp-unit
Make sure the system, =lisp-unit= is installed using ASDF.
#+NAME: lu-install
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp :tangle no
  (asdf:load-system :lisp-unit)
#+END_SRC
* Create test package
This will create a separate package for tests rather than lumping them into the 'parent' package.
#+NAME: lu-package
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp :tangle no
  (in-package :eliza)
#+END_SRC
* Test One
#+NAME: lu-test-one
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp :tangle no
  (define-test test-one
      (assert-equal 5 5))
#+END_SRC
