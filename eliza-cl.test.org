#+TITLE: Eliza Tests
# Intended for import at level 2
* Introduction
This is mostly an experiment:

1. At the emacs level it is about building compound documents using =#+INCLUDE:= to break up org documents.

2. At the literate programming level it is about beginning to incorporate testing into literate documents.

3. At the Common Lisp level is about learning =lisp-unit= for unit testing.

4. At the Common Lisp development environment level it is about learning =quicklisp=. It is good that I broke =quicklisp= and =ASDF= into seperate exercises. Without understanding a bit about =ASDF= I was confused when looking at =quicklisp= and when I looked at =quicklisp= it just made me confused about =ASDF=.
